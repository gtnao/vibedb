# VibeDB Implementation Summary

## Completed Features

### 1. Transaction SQL Support ✅
- **SQL Syntax**: `BEGIN [TRANSACTION|WORK]`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`
- **Implementation**:
  - Added transaction tokens to lexer (src/sql/token.rs)
  - Added transaction statements to AST (src/sql/ast.rs)
  - Added transaction parsing to SQL parser (src/sql/parser.rs)
  - Added transaction variants to logical/physical plans
  - Integrated with session and network protocol
- **Current Status**: Returns placeholder messages; ready for TransactionManager integration
- **Example**: See `examples/transaction_demo.rs`

### 2. Aggregate Executor ✅
- **Supported Functions**: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX
- **Features**:
  - Hash-based aggregation with GROUP BY support
  - Proper NULL handling according to SQL semantics
  - Efficient one-pass execution using hash tables
  - Support for multiple aggregate functions in single query
- **Implementation**:
  - Full aggregate executor in `src/executor/aggregate.rs`
  - Integration with session executor creation
  - Support for HashAggregate physical plan nodes
- **Example**: See `examples/simple_aggregate_test.rs`

### 3. CREATE TABLE SQL Support (Partial) ⚠️
- **SQL Syntax**: Parsed correctly but execution blocked
- **Issue**: Catalog mutability - requires `&mut self` but session has `Arc<Catalog>`
- **Workaround**: Tables must be created programmatically via `Database::create_table_with_columns()`
- **TODO**: Refactor catalog to use interior mutability (RwLock)

## Pending Features

### 1. SQL Parsing for Aggregates
- Need to detect aggregate functions in SELECT and convert to GROUP BY plan
- Handle column resolution for GROUP BY expressions
- Support for HAVING clause

### 2. Transaction Manager Integration
- Connect BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK to actual TransactionManager
- Implement proper transaction isolation
- Handle transaction state in session

### 3. Catalog Mutability Fix
- Refactor Catalog to support CREATE TABLE via SQL
- Use interior mutability pattern (RwLock/Mutex)
- Ensure thread-safe table creation

## Code Quality Notes

### Warnings to Address
1. Unused variable `_order` in catalog.rs
2. Unused fields in ProtocolHandler
3. Unused method `logical_to_expression` in session.rs

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Aggregate Implementation**: Used hash-based aggregation for efficiency
2. **Transaction Support**: Layered approach - SQL parsing complete, execution pending
3. **Catalog Design**: Currently immutable reference, needs refactoring for DDL operations

## Testing
- Transaction SQL: Tested via `examples/transaction_demo.rs`
- Aggregate Executor: Comprehensive unit tests + `examples/simple_aggregate_test.rs`
- Integration: Ready for psql client testing once SQL parsing is complete

## Next Steps
1. Implement aggregate function detection in SQL parser
2. Connect transactions to TransactionManager
3. Refactor catalog for mutability
4. Add comprehensive SQL tests for all features

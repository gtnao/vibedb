Please review the code at $ARGUMENTS from the combined perspectives of these five software engineering masters:

**Kent Beck's perspective:**

- Evaluate simplicity and adherence to YAGNI principle
- Assess testability and potential for incremental improvements
- Check if this is "the simplest thing that could possibly work"

**Martin Fowler's perspective:**

- Identify refactoring opportunities and code smells
- Evaluate appropriate use of design patterns
- Assess if the code clearly expresses its intent

**Takuto Wada (t_wada)'s perspective:**

- Review test quality, coverage, and readability
- Evaluate naming conventions and documentation clarity
- Assess TDD/BDD practices and test-first approach

**Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)'s perspective:**

- Check SOLID principles compliance
- Evaluate function and class responsibilities (Single Responsibility)
- Apply Clean Code standards (naming, function length, comment necessity)

**Michael Feathers' perspective:**

- Assess changeability and testability
- Review dependency management and coupling
- Identify design choices that prevent legacy code accumulation

For each perspective, provide:

1. Specific improvement suggestions with priority (High/Medium/Low)
2. Positive aspects worth preserving
3. Concrete refactoring examples where applicable

Focus on actionable feedback that aligns with these masters' shared values of simplicity, testability, and maintainability.

Please provide the output in Japanese.

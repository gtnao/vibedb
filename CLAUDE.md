# 🚨 ABSOLUTE EXECUTION RULES

## MANDATORY

1. **NEVER STOP until ALL tasks are complete** - No confirmations, reports, or consultations needed
2. **Create TODO list at the top of CLAUDE.md and update with ✓ as you progress**
3. **Report progress via Slack MCP tools when available** - Use mcp**slack-message**send_message for updates

## TODO Format (KEEP FLAT - NO NESTING)

'''markdown

# TODO: [Task Name]

- [ ] Specific task 1 description
- [ ] Specific task 2 description
- [ ] Specific task 3 description
- [x] Completed task

Current:

## FORBIDDEN

- "Shall I continue?" "Is this okay?" or ANY confirmation
- "I've completed X" or ANY progress reports **in Claude Code terminal**
- Waiting for user response
- Stopping on errors (find workarounds and continue)

## ONLY EXCEPTION

Fatal system errors only. Otherwise **RUN TO COMPLETION NO MATTER WHAT**.

# vibedb Development Rules

## Coding Rules

1. **Module Management - CRITICAL RULE**

   - **NEVER CREATE mod.rs FILES** - This is the #1 most important rule
   - Define modules directly in parent files
   - Example of CORRECT module structure:
     ```
     src/
       lib.rs          # Contains: pub mod catalog;
       catalog.rs      # Main catalog module
       catalog/        # Submodules directory
         table_info.rs
         column_info.rs
     ```
   - In catalog.rs, declare submodules like:
     ```rust
     pub mod table_info;
     pub mod column_info;
     ```
   - Run `./check_no_mod_rs.sh` before any commit to verify no mod.rs exists

2. **Testing**

   - Write tests in the same file as implementation (except E2E tests)
   - Write tests inside `#[cfg(test)]` module

3. **Quality Assurance**

   - Ensure all following commands pass:
     - `./check_no_mod_rs.sh` (MUST run this first!)
     - `cargo build`
     - `cargo test`
     - `cargo fmt`
     - `cargo clippy`

4. **Version Control**
   - Execute `git commit` and `git push` after all commands pass
